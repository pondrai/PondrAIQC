# PONDR AI QC

This repository contains the quality control of the raw T1W images from a collection of
public datasets, totaling approximately 40,000.

Images are rated on a 6 point scale, with 1 being good and 6 being bad.

Manuela Costantino performed the manual quality control rating on 10-slice stacks of
Axial, Coronal, & Sagittal Planes on raw images, aligned to MNI ICBM NLIN SYM 09c space.

The [QC Guide](PondrAIQC_Raw_Image_Quality_Control_Manuela_Costantino.pdf) contains examples of the ratings.

Each CSV file contains two columns:

1. The filename of the T1W image
2. The rating
